# Operator Overloading

# Whenever an operator is used in Python, its corresponding method is invoked to perform its 
# predefined function. For example, when the + operator is called, it invokes the special function,
#  __add__, in Python, but this operator acts differently for different data types.

print(5 + 3)
print("Money" + "Maker")


# Overloading operators for a user-defined class
# We are going to implement a class that represents a complex number.â€œ A complex number consists of a real part and an imaginary part.
# When we add a complex number, the real part is added to the real part, and the imaginary part is added to the imaginary part.
# Similarly, when we subtract a complex number, the real part is subtracted from the real part, and the imaginary part is subtracted from the imaginary part.

    def __init__(self, real = 0, imag = 0):
        self.real = real

        temp = Com(self.real + other.real, self.imag + other.imag)
        return temp
    
    def __sub__(self, other): # overloading the - operator
