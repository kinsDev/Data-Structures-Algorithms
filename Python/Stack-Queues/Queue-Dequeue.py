Queue: Dequeue
Implement the dequeue method for the Queue class that removes the first node from the queue and returns it.

The method should perform the following tasks:

If the queue is empty (i.e., the length is 0), return None.

Store a reference to the current first node in a temporary variable, temp.

If the queue has only one node (i.e., the length is 1), set both the first and last attributes of the Queue class to None.

If the queue has more than one node, perform the following steps:

Update the first attribute of the Queue class to point to the next node in the queue.

Set the next attribute of the removed node (stored in the temporary variable) to None.

Decrement the length attribute of the Queue class by 1.

Return the removed node (stored in the temporary variable).
