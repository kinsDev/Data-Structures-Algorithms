The following steps can be performed to implement the algorithm above:

We initialize two pointers, fast and slow, which point to the head of the linked list.

We traverse the linked list using these two pointers. They move in the following way:

The slow pointer moves only one node forward in each iteration.

The fast pointer moves two nodes forward in each iteration, which means that it skips a node.

If the fast pointer becomes NULL, we have reached the end of the linked list. Since no cycle exists, return FALSE.

If both slow and fast pointers become equal to each other, return TRUE, since a cycle exists in the linked list.
