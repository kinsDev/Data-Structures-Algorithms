"""
This problem aims to verify that the abbreviation correctly corresponds to the given word by matching letters directly and properly interpreting numbers as skipped characters. The two pointers technique can be useful here, where we initialize one pointer at the start of the word and another at the start of the abbreviation. Next, we will incrementally iterate over both strings simultaneously to verify that the character matches at each step. When encountering a number in the abbreviation, we skip the exact count of characters in the word while ensuring that this count has no leading zeros. By maintaining these checks and iterating over both strings, we can ensure that the abbreviation correctly represents the word.

Having said this, here’s the algorithm that we’ll use to solve the given problem:

We create two pointers: word_index and abbr_index, both initialized to 
0
0
.

Next, we iterate through the abbreviations string while abbr_index is less than the length of abbr:

If a digit is encountered at abbr[abbr_index]:

We then check if that digit is a leading zero. If it is, we return FALSE.

Next, we calculate the number from abbr and skip that many characters in word.

In case the value at index abbr[abbr_index] is a letter:

We then check for characters that match with word[word_index]. If the characters don’t match in both strings, we return FALSE.

Next, we increment both word_index and abbr_index by 1.

Finally, we ensure whether both pointers, word_index and abbr_index, have reached the end of their strings. If they have, we return TRUE. Otherwise, we return FALSE.
