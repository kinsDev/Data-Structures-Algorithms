LL: Reverse Between ( ** Interview Question)
⚠️ Advanced Challenge Alert: Linked List Mastery!

Welcome to what many consider the pinnacle of Linked List challenges in this course! This exercise is not just a test of your coding skills, but also a measure of your problem-solving ability and understanding of complex data structures.

Here's how you can tackle it:

Visualize the Problem: Before diving into coding, grab a pen and paper. Sketch out the linked list and visualize each step of the process. This approach isn't just for beginners; it's exactly how seasoned developers plan their attack on complex problems.

Seek Understanding Over Speed: Take your time to really grasp each part of the problem. The goal here is deep understanding, not just a quick solution. If you find yourself stuck, that's a part of the learning process.

It's Okay to Take a Break: Feel free to step away from this challenge and return later. This course is designed to equip you with a growing set of skills, and sometimes, a bit of distance can bring new insights.

Approach Like a Pro: Remember, facing a challenging problem is what being a professional developer is all about. Use this exercise to think, plan, and code like a pro.



Now, let's dive into the exercise:

___________________________________



You are given a singly linked list and two integers start_index and end_index.

Your task is to write a method reverse_between within the LinkedList class that reverses the nodes of the linked list from start_index to  end_index (inclusive using 0-based indexing) in one pass and in-place.

Note: the Linked List does not have a tail which will make the implementation easier.

Assumption: You can assume that start_index and end_index are not out of bounds.



Input

The method reverse_between takes two integer inputs start_index and end_index.

The method will only be passed valid indexes (you do not need to test whether the indexes are out of bounds)



Output

The method should modify the linked list in-place by reversing the nodes from start_index to  end_index.

If the linked list is empty or has only one node, the method should return None.



Example

Suppose the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, and start_index = 2 and end_index = 4. Then, the method should modify the linked list to 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 .



Constraints

The algorithm should run in one pass and in-place, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
